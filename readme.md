# Virtual parent

What do you think a child needs the most? A toy?, school? well how about a parent? Yes, there are about 140 million orphan children world wide and 
the number of children being adopted has been reducing each year. We realized that technology could help us solve this problem, even if not 100% its still a
try.

We are still in our early stages of developing the parent. We welcome all contributions.
